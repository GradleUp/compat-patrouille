# 0.3.0
_2025-12-08_

* [NEW] Add `checkDependencies()` as a shortcut for both `checkApiDependencies()` and `checkRuntimeDependencies()`. `checkDependencies()` also checks for the Java class files version (#58, #49, #37) 
* [FIX] Make the plugin react to other plugins (#51, #58). The order in which plugins are applied should now be unimportant.
* [FIX] Reorganize the dependency checking logic and only check the dependencies for JVM consumable configurations. Test dependencies are not checked anymore (#47).
* [CHANGE] Checking the dependencies is now lenient. If no java/kotlin version is set, no check will be made and no error will be raised. (#53)
* [CHANGE] Downgrade the JVM stdlib instead of setting `coreLibrariesVersion`. Setting `coreLibrariesVersion` had unfortunate effects in KMP projects and I hope this approach will be more robust (#49, #56).


# 0.2.0
_2025-11-27_

## Project is renamed to `tapmoc`

`tapmoc` is backwards `compat`! Many thanks @JakeWharton for the nice name 💙

You'll need to update your plugin id and extension block:

```kotlin
plugins {
  // Replace
  id("com.gradleup.compat.patrouille").version("0.1.0")
  // With 
  id("com.gradleup.tapmoc").version("0.2.0")
}

// replace 
compatPatrouille {
  java(17)
  kotlin("2.0.0")
}

// with 
tapmoc {
  java(17)
  kotlin("2.0.0")
}
```

## Other changes

* `TapmocExtension::kotlin()` may now be called even if KGP is not present in the build classpath (#42). This makes it easier to use tapmoc in a central convention plugin. It also allows checking runtime dependencies for incompatible usages of `kotlin-stdlib` for Java projects that may rely on Kotlin dependencies.
* Use `implementation` instead of `api` for the `kotlin-stdlib` configuration of non-JVM tests, fixes a warning when using KGP 2.3.0. (#41)
* Make the plugin uses lazier Gradle APIs (#33, #34), many thanks @simonlebras.
